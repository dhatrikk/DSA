## 📋 Problem Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

	- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
**Output:** [0,2,1,3]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
**Output:** [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`

	- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`

	- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`

	- `a_i != b_i`

	- All the pairs `[a_i, b_i]` are **distinct**.

## ✅ Accepted Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pre) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> ind(n,0);

        for(auto it:pre){
            adj[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
            ind[it[0]]++;
        }
        vector<int> ans;
        queue<int> q;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(ind[i]==0){
                q.push(i);
                ans.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        int node;

        while(!q.empty()){
            node=q.front();
            q.pop();
            for(int ngh:adj[node]){
                ind[ngh]--;
                if(ind[ngh]==0){
                    q.push(ngh);
                    ans.push_back(ngh);
                }
            }
        }

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(ind[i]){
             return {};
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

## 💡 Hints

**Hint 1:** This problem is equivalent to finding the topological order in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.

**Hint 2:** Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.

**Hint 3:** Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
